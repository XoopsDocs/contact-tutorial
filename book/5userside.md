# 5.0 The User Side

Users access the Contact Us form via a link in the main menu. They simply type their message into the “comments” section of the form and press the “submit” button to post it. If they are logged in the form will  automatically be filled in with the contact details listed in their profile (anonymous users must enter their details manually).
